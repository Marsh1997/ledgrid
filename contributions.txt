Sam Allen's Front end shenanigans

Now my contributions to this project were front end
I did a majority of the CSS and got the pages to animate so that the text sildes in smoothly from the side 
I also desgined the way the task bar looks including the shapes behind the text and how the text glows and changes color when the mouse hovers over it 
and also layouts  for the login page(index), send message, and reset password screen making sure the theme of each page I worked on stayed consistant with the schools colors,
as well as the fonts colors and font styles examples include the glow/shadow on the text. 
I aidded in the creation of the reset password function by helping moddify code from the login page (resetpassword.php, ResetPass.js)

Munira Hassan Interior Homepage/Add Pages

My contribution to this project were to add pages and make the homepage pretty where the auidence get drawing into. I hade an idea to record our fadecandy led 
lights saying our name and convert it to a gif. I added the gif video to the homepage where the audience can get a visual what our project is. I wanted our audience 
to get drawing into the gif and make it easy to have a visual about what our project is becasue some people might not know what fadecandy is.I added a background 
page, describing what fadecandy is. Also added a new page "how it works", talking about how does fadecandy works and what software we used for the coding style.
I made the text look neat and easy to read for the auidence.
